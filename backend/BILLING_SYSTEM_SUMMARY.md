## Configuration Required

### Environment Variables
```bash
# Stripe Configuration
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_...
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_...
STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_...  # For frontend
```

### Database Migration
Run the new migrations:
```bash
cd backend
python migrations/run_migrations.py
```

### Stripe Setup
1. Create products and prices in Stripe Dashboard
2. Update `subscription_plans` table with Stripe IDs
3. Configure webhook endpoint: `https://your-domain.com/api/billing/stripe/webhook`
4. Select webhook events to listen for:
   - `payment_intent.succeeded`
   - `invoice.payment_succeeded`
   - `customer.subscription.updated`
   - `customer.subscription.deleted`

## Usage Examples

### Check Credit Balance
```python
# In an API endpoint
balance = await credit_service.get_balance(organization_id)
print(f"Available: {balance['available']} credits")
```

### Consume Credits in Agent
```python
class ContentAgent(BaseCrew):
    async def generate_content(self, topic: str):
        # Credits are automatically consumed
        await self.consume_credits_for_action(
            action='generate_content',
            metadata={'topic': topic}
        )
        
        # Generate content
        result = await self._generate(topic)
        return result
```

### Purchase Credits
```javascript
// Frontend example
const response = await fetch('/api/billing/purchase-credits', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
        'Authorization': `Bearer ${token}`,
        'Content-Type': 'application/json'
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({
        package_id: 'package-uuid',
        payment_method_id: 'pm_xxx'
    })
});
```

## Subscription Plans

| Plan | Price | Credits/Month | Features |
|------|-------|---------------|----------|
| Starter | $29/mo | 500 | Basic features, 1 project |
| Professional | $99/mo | 2,000 | API access, 5 projects |
| Enterprise | $299/mo | 10,000 | Unlimited projects, custom integrations |

## Credit Packages

| Package | Credits | Price | Per Credit |
|---------|---------|-------|------------|
| Small | 100 | $9.90 | $0.099 |
| Medium | 500 | $39.90 | $0.080 |

## Next Steps

1. **Frontend Integration**
   - Build billing UI components
   - Integrate Stripe Elements for payment
   - Create usage dashboard

2. **Monitoring**
   - Set up alerts for low balances
   - Create admin dashboard for credit management
   - Implement usage analytics

3. **Optimization**
   - Cache credit balances
   - Batch credit consumption for bulk operations
   - Implement credit expiration policies

4. **Testing**
   - Test Stripe webhook handling
   - Test subscription lifecycle
   - Load test credit consumption

## Security Considerations

1. Always validate webhook signatures
2. Use Stripe's test mode for development
3. Never expose service keys to frontend
4. Implement rate limiting on credit consumption
5. Regular audit of credit usage patterns

## Support

For issues or questions:
- Check Stripe logs in dashboard
- Review backend logs for credit consumption
- Monitor `credit_transactions` table for audit trail
