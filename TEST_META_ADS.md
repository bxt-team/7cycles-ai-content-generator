# Testing Mobile Analytics - Meta Ads & Google Analytics

## Meta Ads - Production Only

The Meta Ads tool now requires **production credentials** and will return errors if not properly configured.

### Requirements
1. **Environment Variables** (required):
   - `META_APP_ID` - Your Meta app ID
   - `META_APP_SECRET` - Your Meta app secret
   - `META_AD_ACCOUNT_ID` - Your ad account ID (format: act_123456789)

2. **Access Token** (required per request):
   - Must be provided with each API request
   - See `META_ADS_PRODUCTION_SETUP.md` for how to generate tokens

### Error Responses
If credentials are missing, you'll receive one of these errors:
- **NO_ACCESS_TOKEN**: "Please provide a Meta access token to analyze campaigns"
- **API_NOT_CONFIGURED**: "Meta API credentials not found in environment"

## How to Test

1. Start the backend server:
```bash
npm run dev-backend
```

2. Start the frontend:
```bash
npm run dev-frontend
```

3. Navigate to Mobile Analytics interface and click on the "Meta Ads" tab

4. Enter your credentials:
   - **Campaign ID**: A real Campaign ID from your Meta Ads Manager
   - **Access Token**: Your Meta access token (required)
   - The tool will fetch real-time data from Meta's API
   
   **Note**: Mock/test data is no longer available. You must provide valid credentials.

5. Optionally set a date range

6. Click "Analyze Meta Ads Performance"

## Note about API Keys

### Meta Ads

**Production Credentials Required:**
To use Meta Ads analytics, you must have:
- `META_APP_ID` - Your Meta app ID (set in .env)
- `META_APP_SECRET` - Your Meta app secret (set in .env)
- `META_AD_ACCOUNT_ID` - Your ad account ID (set in .env)
- Access Token - Must be provided with each request

See `META_ADS_PRODUCTION_SETUP.md` for detailed setup instructions.

**Error Handling:**
The system will return appropriate error messages if:
- No access token is provided: "Authentication required"
- Environment variables are missing: "Meta Ads API not configured"
- API call fails: Specific error from Meta's API

### Google Analytics
**No API key is needed for Google Analytics** in the current implementation. The backend uses mock data. In production, you would need:
- Google Cloud Project with Analytics API enabled
- Service Account credentials
- GA4 Property access

But for testing, any property ID or app ID will work and return simulated data.

## Play Store Analysis

Regarding your question about Play Store analysis:
- **Play Store analysis is fully implemented** and working
- **No API key is needed** - it uses web scraping
- If you're seeing "Play Store analysis coming soon!", please check:
  1. Make sure you're on the "Android" tab
  2. Enter either a Play Store URL or Package ID
  3. The error might be from a different feature

The "coming soon" messages were only for Meta Ads and Google Analytics, which I've now fixed for Meta Ads.
