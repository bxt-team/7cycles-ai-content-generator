  - `consume_credits_for_action()` - Deduct credits for actions
  - `check_credits_available()` - Check balance without consuming
- Added `_run_async()` helper to agents that needed it
- Updated example agents:
  - `VisualPostCreatorAgent` - Consumes credits in `find_background_image()`
  - `QAAgent` - Consumes credits in `answer_question()`
- Created decorators in `app/core/decorators.py` for easier integration

### 4. Frontend Billing Components (Completed)
- Created comprehensive React components:
  - `CreditBalance` - Shows current balance and status
  - `SubscriptionCard` - Displays active subscription
  - `CreditUsageChart` - Analytics with charts (bar & pie)
  - `PaymentHistory` - Payments and invoices table
  - `CreditPackages` - Purchase credit packages UI
  - `BillingDashboard` - Main billing page with tabs
- Integrated billing tab into `OrganizationSettings` component
- All components include error handling and loading states

## üîß What You Need to Do

### 1. Configure Stripe (When Ready)
```bash
# Add to your .env file:
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_...
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_...
STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_...
```

### 2. Set Up Stripe Products
1. Create subscription products in Stripe Dashboard
2. Update `subscription_plans` table with Stripe product/price IDs:
```sql
UPDATE subscription_plans 
SET stripe_product_id = 'prod_xxx', stripe_price_id = 'price_xxx'
WHERE name = 'Starter';
```

### 3. Configure Webhook Endpoint
- Add webhook endpoint in Stripe: `https://your-domain.com/api/billing/stripe/webhook`
- Select events: payment_intent.succeeded, invoice.payment_succeeded, etc.
