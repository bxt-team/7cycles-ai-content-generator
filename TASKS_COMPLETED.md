# Tasks Completed ✅

## 1. Updated Components to Use API Service

I've successfully updated the following components to use the centralized `apiService` instead of direct axios calls:

### Updated Components:
- ✅ **QAInterface.tsx** - Q&A functionality now uses apiService
- ✅ **AffirmationsInterface.tsx** - Affirmations generation and listing
- ✅ **VisualPostsInterface.tsx** - Visual posts creation and management
- ✅ **InstagramPostsInterface.tsx** - Instagram post generation
- ✅ **ContentGenerator.tsx** - Content generation workflow
- ✅ **WorkflowManagement.tsx** - Workflow execution and management

### Benefits:
- Automatic authentication header injection
- Organization/project context headers automatically added
- Centralized error handling
- Token refresh logic in one place
- No more hardcoded API URLs

## 2. Created Project Management UI

### New Component: ProjectManagement.tsx

Features implemented:
- **Projects Tab**:
  - List all projects in current organization
  - Create new projects
  - Select active project
  - Delete projects (owners only)
  - Visual indicator for active project

- **Details Tab**:
  - View and edit project details
  - Update project name and description
  - View creation date and user role

- **Members Tab**:
  - List project members with roles
  - Add members from organization
  - Remove members (owners only)
  - Role-based access control

### Integration:
- Added route `/projects` in App.tsx
- Added menu item in UserMenu.tsx with folder icon
- Fully integrated with AuthContext for project selection
- Persists selected project in localStorage

## API Service Enhancements

Added missing endpoints to apiService:
- `instagram.prepareContent()` - Prepare Instagram content
- `instagram.postToInstagram()` - Post to Instagram

## Next Steps (Optional)

1. **Update Remaining Components**: There are still some components using direct axios calls that could be updated
2. **Add More Project Features**:
   - Project-specific settings
   - Project activity logs
   - Resource usage per project
3. **Implement Invitation Flow**: Accept/reject invitations UI
4. **Add Subscription Management**: Upgrade/downgrade plans

## Summary

The frontend now has:
- ✅ Complete authentication system
- ✅ Multi-tenant organization/project management
- ✅ Centralized API service with auth
- ✅ Updated core components to use apiService
- ✅ Full project management UI
