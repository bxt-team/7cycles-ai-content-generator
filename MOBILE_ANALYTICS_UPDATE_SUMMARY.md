# Mobile Analytics Update Summary

## Issues Addressed

### 1. Play Store API Integration
- **Problem**: The Play Store scraper was using HTML scraping which is unreliable and often blocked by Google
- **Solution**: Created a new `PlayStoreAPITool` that uses the `google-play-scraper` library for more reliable data fetching
- **Files Modified**:
  - Created: `backend/app/tools/mobile_analytics/play_store_api_tool.py`
  - Updated: `backend/app/agents/play_store_analyst/play_store_analyst_agent.py`
  - Updated: `requirements.txt` - Added `google-play-scraper>=1.2.4`

### 2. Cost Tracking Implementation
- **Problem**: No visibility into AI agent costs per request
- **Solution**: Implemented comprehensive cost tracking system for all mobile analytics agents
- **Features**:
  - Real-time cost estimation based on token usage
  - Per-agent cost tracking
  - Session, daily, and monthly cost summaries
  - Cost information included in analysis results

#### Files Created/Modified for Cost Tracking:
- Created: `backend/app/core/cost_tracker.py` - Core cost tracking module
- Updated: `backend/app/agents/crews/base_crew.py` - Added cost tracking to base class
- Updated: `backend/app/models/mobile_analytics/play_store_analysis.py` - Added cost_estimate field
- Updated: `backend/app/api/routers/mobile_analytics.py` - Added cost endpoints

### 3. Delete Functionality for Analyses
- **Problem**: No way to delete old or unwanted analyses
- **Solution**: Added delete functionality to backend and frontend
- **Features**:
  - Delete individual Play Store analyses
  - Confirmation dialog before deletion
  - Automatic refresh of analysis list after deletion
  - Disabled delete button during deletion process

#### Files Modified for Delete Feature:
- Updated: `backend/app/agents/play_store_analyst/play_store_analyst_agent.py` - Added `delete_analysis()` method
- Updated: `backend/app/api/routers/mobile_analytics.py` - Added DELETE endpoint
- Updated: `frontend/src/components/MobileAnalyticsInterface.tsx` - Added delete button and functionality
- Updated: `frontend/src/components/MobileAnalyticsInterface.css` - Added delete button styles

## New API Endpoints

### Cost Tracking Endpoints
- `GET /api/mobile-analytics/costs/session` - Get current session costs
- `GET /api/mobile-analytics/costs/daily/{date}` - Get costs for specific date
- `GET /api/mobile-analytics/costs/monthly/{year}/{month}` - Get monthly cost summary

### Analysis Management Endpoints
- `DELETE /api/mobile-analytics/play-store/analyses/{analysis_id}` - Delete a specific Play Store analysis

## Cost Tracking Usage

The cost tracking system automatically tracks:
- Token usage (prompt, completion, total)
- Estimated costs based on model pricing
- Cost breakdown by agent and model
- Historical cost data

Example response from session costs endpoint:
```json
{
  "total_cost": 0.0456,
  "total_tokens": 1520,
  "requests": 3,
  "by_agent": {
    "PlayStoreAnalystAgent": {
      "cost": 0.0456,
      "tokens": 1520,
      "requests": 3
    }
  },
  "by_model": {
    "gpt-4": {
      "cost": 0.0456,
      "tokens": 1520,
      "requests": 3
    }
  },
  "currency": "USD"
}
```

## Play Store API Improvements

The new Play Store API tool provides:
- Reliable app data fetching using google-play-scraper
- Detailed app metrics including:
  - App metadata (name, developer, category, etc.)
  - Ratings and review counts
  - Download statistics
  - Screenshots and visual assets
  - Recent reviews with sentiment
  - Performance scoring
- Fallback mechanism if google-play-scraper is not available

## Next Steps

1. Install the new dependency:
   ```bash
   pip install google-play-scraper
   ```

2. Test the Play Store analysis with the new API tool

3. Monitor cost tracking to ensure accurate cost estimation

4. Consider adding:
   - Cost budgets and alerts
   - Cost optimization recommendations
   - More detailed token usage tracking per LLM call
   - Frontend UI to display cost information

## Frontend Integration (Optional)

To display costs in the frontend, you can:
1. Fetch cost data from the new endpoints
2. Display cost estimates alongside analysis results
3. Show cost trends over time
4. Add cost monitoring dashboard

The cost information is already included in analysis results, so you can access it via the `cost_estimate` field in the response.
