## **What does prudence mean?**

Prudence means **acting consciously and foresightfully**. It's about being clear about the consequences of your decisions and considering both your own needs and those of your fellow human beings and your environment.

This period promotes **letting go of old issues** and helps you create space for new things - however, only in a later phase. During this time, it's about **completing unfinished things** and reflecting on existing situations.

### **Prudence manifests in various areas of life:**

✔ **Physically:** Pay attention to your health, eat consciously, and find a balance between activity and recovery.  
 ✔ **Emotionally:** Be aware of your feelings, consider, and avoid impulsive reactions.  
 ✔ **Socially:** Examine your relationships and recognize which connections are strengthening and which should perhaps be let go.  
 ✔ **Professionally:** Avoid hasty decisions. Rely on well-thought-out strategies instead of spontaneous actions.
