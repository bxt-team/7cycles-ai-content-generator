## **Description**

The first period of the Year Cycle (Y) begins with your birth date or with the founding date in the business context. This cycle extends over one year and a total of seven periods, with the last period being one day longer. This makes the year cycle last a total of 365 days. Unlike the conventional calendar, the beginning of the year cycle is oriented to your birth date or the founding date.

Activities that fall within this time should ideally also begin with the appropriate period from the week cycle. Plan so that your activities are completed within the year cycle or shortly thereafter. These activities extend over a period of about one year, and you can expect to see results during this cycle.
