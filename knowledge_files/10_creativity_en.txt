## **What does creativity mean from a holistic perspective?**

Creativity is the ability to create something new - something that is not only innovative but also meaningful and useful. It manifests in many areas of life: in art, in science, in the working world, and in everyday life.

### **Creativity as an expression of your wholeness**

From a holistic perspective, creativity is not just an ability of the mind, but a connection between mind, body, and soul. It is an expression of your entire personality, your experiences, and your inspirations.

Creativity begins with an open and curious attitude. Creative people are willing to question old thought patterns and go new ways. They allow themselves to be inspired by their environment, think outside familiar structures, and can connect seemingly unrelated things.

Creativity is also an ongoing process of learning and growing. It arises through constant development, new experiences, and the courage to make mistakes. At the same time, it is an expression of your connection to the world - through your perception of beauty, diversity, and innovation.
