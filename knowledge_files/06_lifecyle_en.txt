## **Description**

Our life rhythm is known to be divided into seven-year cycles â€“ each of these cycles consists of seven individual periods, each lasting one year. This creates the life cycle, which begins individually with a person's birth date and ends with the next birthday. As a result, these phases deviate from the conventional calendar year. In the business context, it is the founding date.

The life cycle repeats every seven years, beginning with the eighth year of life, when a new seven-year cycle begins. This creates a continuous sequence of life cycles that overlap and shape our personal development.

For long-term projects, it is advisable to start activities on the appropriate weekday. Plan important projects, professional changes, or personal developments so that they are completed within this seven-year cycle or shortly thereafter.

By consciously using these natural cycles, you can strategically plan your projects and implement them successfully in the long term.
