## **Description**

**Note:** Choose the appropriate weekday for the optimal start of your activities

The **Week Cycle (W)** consists of seven periods, corresponding to the seven days of the week. This division is based on ancient concepts where certain planets were assigned to individual weekdays. This idea has persisted to this day and influences the energetic quality of each day.

The **beginning of your week cycle** is determined by your birth date and birth time â€“ or in business contexts, by the founding date. While the calendar overview visually looks like a conventional week, your personal week cycle from an energetic perspective begins with your birth date and birth time or with the founding date.

This means:

* The weekday of your birth becomes energetically your "Sunday."
* The energies shift accordingly for you to the other weekdays.
* Example: If you were born on a Thursday, your Friday energetically becomes Monday, your Saturday becomes Tuesday, and so on.
* The energetic "Sunday" (in this example, Thursday) marks the start of a new cycle.

Each day thus has an **individual** effect on your actions. This week cycle lasts seven days and is particularly suitable for short-term activities that should yield results within this time. Plan your projects so that they are ideally completed within this cycle - or shortly thereafter.

This way, you can consciously control your activities in harmony with natural rhythms and find the right moments for decisions and actions.
