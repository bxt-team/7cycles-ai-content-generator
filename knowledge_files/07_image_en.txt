## **What does holistic image mean?**

Image means that you and your achievements, abilities, or qualities are positively valued and appreciated. It can also mean that your identity, opinions, and rights are respected and accepted. Image strengthens self-esteem and promotes harmonious interaction.

However, holistic image goes beyond praise or admiration. It's about perceiving you as a whole person - with all your values, abilities, and uniqueness. It means appreciating not only your external flaws but also your inner qualities.

### **How trustworthy is the holistic image?**

Holistic image can manifest in various ways, for example:

* **Appreciation for your achievements:** Someone recognizes what you have accomplished - whether in your profession, family, or personal growth.  
* **Recognition of your inner values:** Your compassion, intelligence, or generosity are appreciated.  
* **Respect for your decisions and lifestyle:** Others accept your individual paths and support your development.  
* **Support and encouragement:** People motivate you to pursue your goals and offer help.

### **Why is holistic image important?**

Recognition contributes to making you feel valuable, staying motivated, and fully realizing your potential. It helps you develop strong self-confidence and feel connected to others.

Here are some examples of holistic recognition:

* Parents who praise their child for academic progress.  
* A friend who listens attentively and takes you seriously.  
* A supervisor who recognizes your loyalty and commitment.  
* A partner who tells you how much they appreciate and love you.

### **Tips to bring more recognition into your life**

* **Give recognition:** By appreciating others, you will experience the highest recognition yourself.  
* **Be aware of your own values:** Don't just wait for external recognition, but also acknowledge your own progress.  
* **Surround yourself with appreciative people:** Make sure your environment strengthens and supports you.
