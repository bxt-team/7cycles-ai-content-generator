## **What is success from a holistic perspective?**

Success is a multifaceted concept that is not limited to external factors such as professional achievements or material prosperity. Viewed from a holistic perspective, success encompasses all aspects of life - both inner and outer dimensions. It's about leading a fulfilled, happy, and meaningful life that is in harmony with one's own values, goals, and needs.

Holistic success means that we don't just focus on individual areas of life, but bring our entire life into balance. This includes personal development, emotional well-being, spiritual growth, as well as relationships with other people and the world around us.
