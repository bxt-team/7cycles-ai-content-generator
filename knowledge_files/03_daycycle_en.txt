## **Description**

The day cycle is one of the most important cycles and influences your life immediately. This cycle offers you the opportunity to directly shape your life through your daily actions. You will probably use this cycle more often than all others, as it mainly relates to the present and can therefore serve as a guide for the many daily events.

The day cycle is divided into seven periods, corresponding to a period duration of about 24 / 7 = 3.25 hours. This cycle begins on the weekday and at the time of your birth. In the business context, it's the founding date. The last of the seven daily periods ends 24 hours later and marks the beginning of a new cycle. In this case, the quality of the period changes according to the characteristics of the new day. Therefore, this cycle only ends after seven days.

It is important to ensure that the activities you plan in this cycle fall into the appropriate period and are ideally completed within the day cycle - or shortly thereafter. These activities are immediate actions from which you can expect immediate results.
